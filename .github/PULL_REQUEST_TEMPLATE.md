Here are a few things to keep in mind when making a pull request (PR).

* Tests and docstrings are required for new or changed functionality.
* Please take care to write helpful commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
* As a PR nears completion, fellow developers will likely suggest changes
  to be made before the PR is merged.
* Every pull request should include a changelog entry. Please see
  `changelog/README.rst` for instructions.
* PlasmaPy follows the PEP 8 style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
* Please double check that a new PR will not duplicate an existing PR.
* If this PR will solve an issue tracked by GitHub, please add a phrase like
  "Closes #404." to automatically close the issue once the pull request is
  merged.  If your PR will not completely solve the issue, please still
  reference the issue.
* If this is your first contribution, please add your name to the author
  list in `docs/about/credits.rst`.
